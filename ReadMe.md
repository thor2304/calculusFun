# Welcome to CalculusFun
Here I will implement the concepts 
taught in the course Calculus and linear algebra.

It will be done without using maths libraries to jump the gate.

# What will be covered?
Hopefully everything covered in class will translate nicely into code.
Therefore, I expect all concepts covered in class to be implemented here 
(unless I lose interest in this here side quest, which is the most likely outcome).

Among Topics covered already in class are:
- Matrices
  - Multiplication
  - Adding Matrices
  - Calculating determinants
  - Calculating inverses
  - Transposing
- Vectors (as 1 dimensional matrices)
- Gaussian elimination (upcoming)
- Gauss-jordan elimination (upcoming)
- _And many more exciting topics to come ;)_

If the project seems fun there might even come a representation of vector functions.
